# p-adic number theory
## why study p-adic numbers?
* $`\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,...\}`$ is the most boring number system.
* $`\mathbb{Z} = \{...,-2,-1,Â±0,+1,+2,...\}`$ has been boring ever since Leibniz held that negative numbers were invalid and still used them in calculations. 
* $`\mathbb{Q}`$ = the set of "rational" numbers, has been boring ever since Pythagoras made Hippasus walk the plank.
* $`\mathbb{R}`$ = the set of "real" numbers, has been boring ever since Archimedes explained the method of exhaustion.
* $`\mathbb{C}`$ = the set of "complex" numbers, has been boring ever since Hamilton went for a walk and explained the quaternion.
* $`\mathbb{H}`$ = the set of quaternions, has been boring ever since 3D video game programmers discovered "gimbal lock."
* the axioms of geometry have been boring ever since Bolyai threw Euclid's parallel postulate out the window.

## $`p`$ -adic numbers

Enter non-Archimedean algebraic geometry:

* $`\mathbb{Q_p}`$ is the field of $`p`$ -adic numbers, where $`p`$ is a prime number.
* $`\overline{\mathbb{Q_p}}`$ is the algebraic closure of $`\mathbb{Q_p}`$.
